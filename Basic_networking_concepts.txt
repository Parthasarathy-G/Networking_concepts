1. IP Addressing
    - An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It allows devices to communicate with each other.

2. Subnetting
    - Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks. It helps in efficient IP address management and improves network performance.

3. MAC Address
    - A MAC address is a hardware identifier assigned to network interfaces. It is used for communication within a local network segment.

4. DNS (Domain Name System)
    - DNS translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.

5. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
    - DHCP is a network management protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network.

6. TCP/IP Model
    - The TCP/IP model is a set of protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. It includes layers such as the application, transport, internet, and network access layers.

7. OSI Model
    - The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network protocols in seven layers: physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application.

8. Routing
    - Routing is the process of selecting paths in a network along which to send network traffic. Routers are devices that forward data packets between networks.

9. Switches and Hubs
    - Switches and hubs are networking devices used to connect multiple devices on a local network. Switches operate at the data link layer, while hubs operate at the physical layer.

10. Firewalls
     - Firewalls are security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They help protect networks from unauthorized access and cyber threats.

    11. VPN (Virtual Private Network)
        - A VPN extends a private network across a public network, allowing users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly connected to the private network. It provides security and privacy.

    12. NAT (Network Address Translation)
        - NAT is a method used to remap one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit. It helps in conserving global IP addresses and adds a layer of security.

    13. Network Topologies
        - Network topology refers to the arrangement of different elements (links, nodes, etc.) in a computer network. Common topologies include star, ring, bus, mesh, and hybrid.

    14. Wireless Networking
        - Wireless networking allows devices to connect to a network without physical cables. It uses radio waves to provide connectivity and includes standards such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks.

    15. Network Security
        - Network security involves measures to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and resources on a network. It includes practices such as encryption, intrusion detection systems, and secure access controls.
