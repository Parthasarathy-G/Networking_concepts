1. IP Addressing
    - An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It allows devices to communicate with each other.

2. Subnetting
    - Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks. It helps in efficient IP address management and improves network performance.

3. MAC Address
    - A MAC address is a hardware identifier assigned to network interfaces. It is used for communication within a local network segment.

4. DNS (Domain Name System)
    - DNS translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.

5. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
    - DHCP is a network management protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network.

6. TCP/IP Model
    - The TCP/IP model is a set of protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. It includes layers such as the application, transport, internet, and network access layers.

7. OSI Model
    - The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network protocols in seven layers: physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application.

8. Routing
    - Routing is the process of selecting paths in a network along which to send network traffic. Routers are devices that forward data packets between networks.

9. Switches and Hubs
    - Switches and hubs are networking devices used to connect multiple devices on a local network. Switches operate at the data link layer, while hubs operate at the physical layer.

10. Firewalls
     - Firewalls are security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They help protect networks from unauthorized access and cyber threats.
